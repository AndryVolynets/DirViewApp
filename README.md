# DirViewApp
To create a simple file manager using the Qt framework, we can start by designing the basic structure of the application. 
For this example, we'll use QML for the user interface and C++ for the backend logic. The following files are part of the project:

Project Structure:
- icons
- src
  - components
  - constants
  - events
  - modules
  - pages
- App.qml
- CMakeLists.txt
- CMakeLists.txt.user
- filesystemmodel.cpp
- filesystemmodel.h
- index.cpp
